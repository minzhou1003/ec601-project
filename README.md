# Product statement:

* Doctors, patients and medical professionals, need a product to help 
them to improve the efficiency and reach of diagnostic services. 

* This is an AI (machine learning/deep learning) model which can automatically detect a signal of pneumonia in medical images. 

* Current pneumonia diagnosis must be completed by a medical professional following a chest X-Ray and physical exam

* Our product will automate initial detection (imaging screening) of potential pneumonia cases and create bounding boxes around the areas of interest in order to prioritize and expedite their review.
